# Carta Front-End Engineering Challenge
Built a React app that mimics Stanford Carta's search results page. Carta is an app that allows students to navigate various courses at Stanford and evaluate courses based on student reviews. 

## This app renders the list courses, displays the title, course code(s), description, and unit count.
